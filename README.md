# Wilfrid

Wilfrid is a general-purpose, procedural, low-level, statically-typed programming language. 

It's named after [Wilfrid S. Sellars](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/).

Some of the language features are:
* direct access to memory via pointers
* optional garbage collection
* strict type checking with limited implicit conversions
* Go-style syntax
* function overloading
* order-independent declarations
* built-in dynamic arrays
* full interoperability with C

Wilfrid can be compiled to C or run in the interpreter. You can check the **language's interactive demo [here](https://janorzechowski.com/wilfrid)**. Code examples featured on this site can be also found [here](/examples).

Wilfrid is currently in the early alpha stage.
